Perfect — that’s clean and complete. Since you’ve shared your main configuration and core files, here’s a **GitHub-ready README.md** that explains your project clearly, includes setup instructions, and reflects the journey you’ve just been through.

# 🧠 String Analyzer API

A simple RESTful API that analyzes strings and stores their computed properties in MongoDB.
Built as part of the **HNG Backend Track**, this project demonstrates the use of **Node.js**, **Express**, and **MongoDB** with a structured, modern setup.

---

## 🚀 Features

* Analyze any string to extract useful properties:

  * Character count
  * Palindrome detection
  * Character breakdown
* Store and retrieve analyzed strings from MongoDB
* RESTful API with clear, simple routes
* Robust error handling and health check endpoint

---

## 🧩 Tech Stack

* **Node.js (v20.x)**
* **Express.js (v5)**
* **MongoDB (v6)**
* **dotenv** for environment variable management

---

## ⚙️ Setup Instructions

### 1. Clone the Repository

```bash
git clone https://github.com/<your-username>/string-analyzer.git
cd string-analyzer
```

### 2. Install Dependencies

```bash
npm install
```

### 3. Configure Environment Variables

Create a `.env` file in the project root:

```
MONGO_URI=<your-mongo-connection-string>
PORT=4010
MONGO_DB_NAME=string_analyzer
MONGO_COLLECTION=analyzed_strings
```

> ⚠️ Never expose your real MongoDB credentials publicly.

### 4. Start the Server

```bash
npm start
```

You should see logs confirming that MongoDB connected successfully and that your API is running.

| GET    | `/_health` | Health check             |
| POST   | `/analyze` | Analyze a string         |
| GET    | `/results` | Retrieve stored analyses |

## 🧠 Project Motivation

This project took me through a *real* debugging marathon.
I spent **two full days** tracking down a MongoDB connection issue that turned out to be a **DNS resolution error** — one of those problems that feels invisible until you finally see the light.

Honestly, I thought this bug would end my HNG backend journey, but persistence won.
**We move. The struggle continues.**

Would you like me to include a **“How It Works”** section that explains the flow (from user input → string analysis → MongoDB storage → response)? That would make it look more technical and impressive for recruiters on GitHub or LinkedIn.
